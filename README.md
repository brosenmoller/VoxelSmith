# Voxel Smith

Voxel Smith is a 3D level editor based on voxels. The editor includes a subwindow in which you can control a character that allows you to walk/fly through the world. You can place and break voxels from your palette with the help of several different tools.

Furthermore, you can import a project from Minecraft via the ".schematic" file format. When finished, you can export both as a 3D model (OBJ) and also directly to a Unity Prefab. The Unity Prefab export will then ensure that all your loaded prefabs are also exported with it.
